0x14. C - Bit manipulation


Bit manipulation refers to the manipulation of individual bits or groups of bits within a binary representation of data. This can be done using bitwise operators, which perform operations on the binary representation of the data at the bit level.

There are several common bitwise operators:

-Bitwise AND (&): performs a logical AND operation between each corresponding bit of two operands.

-Bitwise OR (|): performs a logical OR operation between each corresponding bit of two operands.

-Bitwise XOR (^): performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation between each corresponding bit of two operands.

-Bitwise NOT (~): performs a logical NOT operation (i.e., inverts all bits) on a single operand.

-Left shift (<<): shifts all bits in a value to the left by a specified number of bits.

-Right shift (>>): shifts all bits in a value to the right by a specified number of bits.

These operators can be used to perform a wide range of operations, including:

1-Setting or clearing individual bits.

2-Checking the value of individual bits.

3-Combining or extracting groups of bits.

4-Performing arithmetic operations on binary values.

Bit manipulation is commonly used in low-level programming, such as device drivers and operating system kernels, where fine-grained control over hardware is required. It can also be used in other applications, such as cryptography, compression algorithms, and graphics processing.
