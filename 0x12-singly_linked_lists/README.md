0x12. C - Singly linked lists
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.

Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.

Tasks 📃
0. Print list

0-print_list.c: C function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
If str is NULL, the function prints [0] (nil).
1. List length

1-list_len.c: C function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
2. Add node

2-add_node.c: C function that adds a new node at the beginning a of a list_t list.
If the function fails - returns NULL.
Otherwise - returns the address of the new element.
3. Add node at the end

3-add_node_end.c: C function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list_t list.
If the function fails - returns NULL.
Otherwise - returns the address of the new element.
4. Free list

4-free_list.c: C function that frees a list_t list.
5. The Hare and the Tortoise

100-first.c: C function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.
6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language

101-hello_holberton.asm: 64-but assembly program that prints Hello, Holberton followed by a new line using only the printf function witout interrupts.
