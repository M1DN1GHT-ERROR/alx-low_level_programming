#0x0B. C - malloc, free#
malloc is a function that is used to dynamically allocate memory during runtime. It stands for "memory allocation", and is typically used in C and C++ programming languages.

The malloc function is used to request a block of memory from the operating system's heap memory, which is then used to store data for the program. The function takes a single argument, which is the number of bytes of memory to allocate.
