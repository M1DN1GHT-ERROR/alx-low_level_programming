#0x0A. C - argc, argv#

'argc stands for "argument count" and is an integer that represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.

argv stands for "argument vector" and is an array of strings that contains the command-line arguments passed to the program.

Together, argc and argv allow a program to receive input from the user through the command line. The first element of the argv array (argv[0]) is always the name of the program itself. The remaining elements (argv[1] through argv[argc-1]) are the command-line arguments passed to the program.
